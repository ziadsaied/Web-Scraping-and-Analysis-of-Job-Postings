# 🧩 Job Roles & Skills Analysis
Python project that analyzes global job roles and technical skills from a real-world survey dataset. The project identifies the most common roles (e.g., Python Developer, Data Scientist), groups “Other” roles into meaningful categories, and highlights top skills by city and profession to reveal hiring and learning trends.

🎯 Project Purpose
Explore and clean job market data to understand role distributions and skill demands.
Standardize job titles, categorize “Other” entries, and visualize patterns in roles and technical expertise across different cities to support career and recruitment insights.

⚙️ Setup / Installation
1- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job-Roles-Skills-Analysis.git

2- Run the notebook or Python script to generate data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

💡 Usage / Results
- Cleaned and normalized inconsistent job titles.
- Categorized “Other” roles into clearer groups.
- Extracted and visualized the most frequent roles and top skills per city.

📊 Example Outputs
- Bar charts showing top job roles and their counts.
